# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project I use Jasmine to write test suites against a feed reader app built by another developer.

## To Run

Open index.html in a browser or run a local server from the main project directory to run the program.

View the results of the Jasmine test suites at the bottom of the page.

These test suites check for:

* RSS Feeds are defined
* RSS Feeds have defined URLs
* RSS Feeds have defined names
* The menu is hidden by default
* The menu changes visibility when clicked
* Initial Entries contain at least one entry
* New Feed Selection contains new content
